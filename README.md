Classifying whether an e-mail is spam or ham.

•	Dataset: Word frequencies from 400 spam e-mails, 400 ham e-mails and external list of spam trigger words.

•	Used: Python, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas.

•	Models: CART, Logistic Regression, kNN, Naive Bayes, MARS, 3-layer Deep Neural Network.

•	Accuracy: 99.5% with Naive Bayes, 99% with DNN, <99% with the remaining models.


The first three parts of this project are introductory notebooks to different machine learning algorithms.

The final part is a performance evaluation of different algorithms on the problem of classifying e-mails as spam or ham.
