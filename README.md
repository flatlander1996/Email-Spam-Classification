The first three parts of this project are introductory notebooks to different machine learning algorithms.
The final part is a performance evaluation of different algorithms on the problem of classifying e-mails as spam or ham.
Algorithms evaluated include:
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Naive Bayes
- MARS
- kNN
- CART
